## Parse Race
Takes a race rusult from "raw-results" and processes it into JSON.

Task should be performed when adding a new XML dump from rFactor. Source doesn't need to committed but it might be handy to keep

```bash
> npm run parse:race -- demo-dump.xml
< saved results: /race/2020-05-04/suzuka-1993.json
```
